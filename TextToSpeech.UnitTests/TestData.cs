In such weather, customers will have to be shooed away with a stick.\r\nPete and the brunette – Trish – get out, cross the alley and forty feet later are on Main Street. The pharmacy is the second building on the left. The fog intensified and almost turned into real rain! The woman puts a new scarf over her hair and looks at Pete, whose head is uncovered.\r\n- You will get wet, - she says.\r\n- I am from the north, - he answers. - And we guys are strong there.\r\n- Do you think we will find them? - she asks.\r\nHe is already gently pushing her to the door, lightly touching her waist. He likes the smell of her perfume and her hair even more. If it is so luxurious when it is raining outside, what is it like in the sun?\r\n- My meeting...\r\n- You still have forty minutes to spare, - he interrupts. - It's not summer now, the tourists have left, so you can easily get to Freiburg in twenty minutes. We'll spend ten minutes looking for the keys, and if we don't find them, I'll drive you myself.\r\nShe looks at him doubtfully. And he glances past her into one of the neighboring offices and shouts:\r\n- Dick! Bye, Dickie M.!\r\nDick MacDonald breaks away from stacks of bills.\r\n- Tell this lady that when you have to take her to Freiburg, you can trust me.\r\n\"Oh, you can trust him, ma'am,\" says Dick. - He is not a sex maniac or a fast driver. Will only try to sell you a new car.\r\n- I'm a tough nut, - she smiles slightly. - But, I think, I will go with you.\r\n- Dick, watch my phone, okay? - asks Pete.";
